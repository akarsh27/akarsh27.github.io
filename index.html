								<h3>ABOUT</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic001.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hello! I'm Sai Akarsh Ache, a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison majoring in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for user experience (UX/UI) and a deep understanding of human-computer interaction principles to create intuitive and impactful designs. My experience includes working on a project focused on designing robots for elderly care, where I gained valuable insights into optimizing user interactions. Additionally, I have earned certifications in Human Subjects Research, including CITI certification and completion of the UW Human Subjects Protections course. As a team leader during my student job at Wisconsin Union, I successfully led a team executing event setups, demonstrating my creative problem-solving skills and ability to meet tight deadlines. With meticulous attention to detail, I optimized resources, fostered collaboration, and delivered precise setups that exceeded client and attendee expectations. I am excited to apply my technical expertise, creative mindset, and leadership skills to contribute effectively to a dynamic organization in roles related to UX/UI and Software Development Engineering.</p>

									<p> 
The project is a web-based platform for athletes to connect with doctors. The system allows athletes to enter their injury information to view a list of expert doctors in that area, along with their availability and ratings. Athletes can schedule appointments with doctors based on their ratings and availability and rate the doctors after their sessions. The goal is to improve upon the current state-of-the-art appointment scheduling system by creating a more user-friendly website. In the future, the plan is also to develop a cross-platform app that will be compatible with Android and iOS devices.</p>

									<p>This Application facilitates ride-sharing by giving users a choice to either offer or find rides. In simple terms, carpooling/ride-sharing refers to sharing empty seats in a vehicle. People commuting from one point to another can share empty seats with other passengers who are traveling on the same route.</p>
