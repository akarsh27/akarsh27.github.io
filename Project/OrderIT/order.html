        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <!-- Problem Overview -->
        <div class="intro-content">
            <p><strong>Order It</strong> is a revolutionary platform that connects students with local restaurants, making it easier than ever for them to order food and have it delivered to their doorstep. With a simple, user-friendly interface and a wide range of options to choose from, Order It has quickly become the go-to solution for students looking to enjoy a delicious meal without the hassle of cooking or leaving their homes.</p>
            <p>But <strong>Order It</strong> isn’t just beneficial for students. It also provides a valuable service to local restaurants, helping them attract a new customer base and grow their businesses. The platform plays a crucial role in supporting the food industry and fostering a sense of community by offering restaurants a way to showcase their menus and reach a wider audience.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Creative Block: The Win-Win Solution -->
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Why We Chose This Problem</h3>
            <p>We identified a gap in the market: the absence of a platform specifically focused on ordering and picking up food on university campuses. Long lines and time constraints often challenge students who want to purchase food from on-campus restaurants.</p>
            <p>Order It solves this issue by offering a pre-order and pickup system, allowing restaurants to better estimate the amount of food needed and attract new customers through convenience and ease of use.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Benefits for Both Parties -->
        <div class="intro-content">
            <h3>A Win-Win for Everyone</h3>
            <p><strong>For Students</strong>: They get quick, convenient, and affordable access to delicious meals without wasting time standing in long lines. </p>
            <p><strong>For Restaurants</strong>: Order It gives them the opportunity to reach new customers and streamline their operations by offering pre-orders and scheduled pickups.</p>
            <p>The platform ensures a seamless, convenient experience for both students and restaurants, solving a significant pain point in university food services.</p>

        <div class="research-overview">
            <h3>Why We Chose University Restaurants</h3>
            <p>For our ethnographic study, we selected university restaurants as our setting because they provide a unique environment where we can closely observe our target audience—students. This setting allowed us to gather valuable insights into the behavior and preferences of this group in real time.</p>

        <!-- Final Thoughts -->
        <div class="intro-content">
            <p>By focusing on university restaurants, we were able to identify key trends and pain points among students, such as their desire for a faster, more convenient way to purchase food. Our study provided insights that were crucial in shaping the features and functions of the <strong>Order It</strong> platform.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Ethnography Process</h2>

    <!-- Fly-on-the-wall Observation -->
    <div class="ethnography-process">
        <h3>1. Fly-on-the-Wall Observation</h3>
        <p>For our problem statement, we chose university restaurants as the primary location, and university students were our targeted audience. We began with a "fly-on-the-wall" observation, immersing ourselves in the environment as passive observers. We joined the students in line and sat around the restaurant to observe and take notes.</p>
        <p>We focused on observing key behaviors such as food preferences, types of orders, and payment methods. Each person spent 2 to 4 hours observing during different times of the day at Union South.</p>
        <p>In order to match the environment and avoid any biases, we took notes on our laptops and mobile phones based on the
            situation we were in. For example, while standing in line, we used our mobile phones to collect notes, and while observing
            the restaurant from a distance, we used our laptops for observation.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Observation Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Students spend an average of 5 to 15 minutes ordering and receiving food, depending on the time of day.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- In-depth Interviews -->
    <div class="ethnography-process">
        <h3>2. In-depth Interviews</h3>
        <p>After gathering observations, we developed detailed interview questions to dive deeper into the issues students face. Our goal was to collect firsthand insights from students about their experiences and potential solutions. We selected a representative sample of students and scheduled interviews with them.</p>
        <p>These semi-structured interviews allowed us to gather valuable insights from the students, particularly about their pain points and suggestions for a more efficient ordering experience.</p>
        <p>During the interviews, we asked the participants a series of carefully crafted questions that were designed to elicit detailed
            and informative responses. These questions covered a wide range of topics, including the specific problems that people are
            facing, their experiences with these problems, and their suggestions for potential solutions. We also asked follow-up
            questions to clarify any unclear responses and to dig deeper into the issues at hand.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Interview Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Students found waiting in line frustrating, particularly during peak hours between classes.</li>
                <li>They appreciated the idea of pre-ordering food but needed assurance that it would save them significant time.</li>

    <!-- Focus Group Discussions -->
    <div class="ethnography-process">
        <h3>3. Focus Group Discussions</h3>
        <p>In our focus group discussions, we gathered a small group of students to discuss their thoughts on our solution. We shared the problem statement and encouraged participants to provide detailed feedback and ideas for improvement.</p>
        <p>We recorded the focus group sessions with the participants' permission and took notes to analyze later.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Focus Group Insights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Students expressed interest in a cross-platform app that would allow them to order food from their classes.</li>
                <li>They valued the convenience of scheduling food pickups but wanted more control over customization options for orders.</li>

        <h2>Prototyping</h2>

        <!-- Full Text Provided -->
        <div class="prototyping-content">
            <p>In developing a video scenario for an online food ordering app, we would begin by creating personas and vignettes that represent the app's target users. These personas and vignettes would be based on market research and user testing, and would provide a detailed understanding of the users' needs, goals, and behaviors. For example, one person could be a college student who is looking for a convenient way to order food on a budget.</p>
            
            <p>Once the personas and vignettes are developed, we would then create a script and storyboards for the video scenario. The script would outline the key scenes and interactions in the video, while the storyboards would provide visual representations of each scene, showing how the app would be used and highlighting its key features and benefits. For example, the script and storyboards we showed how convenient it would be for a student to skip queues by ordering the food through the app and coming to the restaurant at the time of delivery, this saves an insane amount of time.</p>
            
            <p>The final video would showcase the app's key features and benefits, and provide a realistic and engaging depiction of how the app could be used in the real world.</p>
            
            <p>Overall, the development of a video scenario for an online food ordering app would involve creating personas and vignettes, developing a script and storyboards, and working with a video production team to bring the scenario to life. By using this process, the video scenario can provide a realistic and engaging depiction of how the app could be used, and help to showcase its key features and benefits to potential users.</p>

                <p>Akarsh was feeling hungry while studying for an important exam, so he decided to take a break and go to the nearest restaurant to grab a bite to eat. When he arrived, he saw that there was a long line at the restaurant, and it was moving very slowly. Not wanting to waste any more time, Akarsh pulled out his phone and used an application to order his food. He carefully looked through the menu and added his chosen items to his cart, selecting a pickup time that would work best for him. Once he had placed his order, Akarsh returned to studying. When it was time to pick up his food, he quickly retrieved it from the restaurant and returned to his studies without any further delay. Akarsh was glad that he was able to use the app to avoid wasting more time and was able to get back to studying without any delays.</p>

                <p>Akarsh is a student who is currently focusing on his studies in the library. He is feeling hungry, so he plans to take a break and go outside to grab some food. However, when he looks outside, he sees that it is snowing heavily. Not wanting to get wet and cold, Akarsh decides to use a food delivery app to place an order instead. He browses the app for restaurants that are on and off campus, and carefully considers all of the options before choosing a dish. The restaurant receives the order and starts preparing the food, ensuring that it will be delivered to Akarsh in a timely manner. Thanks to the convenience of the food delivery app, Akarsh is able to avoid the bad weather and still enjoy a delicious meal. He is happy with his decision and continues to focus on his studies in the library, feeling satisfied and content.</p>

                <h3>Scenario Three: Akarsh Bypasses the Line</h3>
                <p>Akarsh is a busy student who often uses a food delivery app to order food for pickup. One day, he wants to pick up food for the next morning, so he places an order on the app as soon as the restaurant opens. Akarsh selects a pickup time that is convenient for him and confirms the order. The next morning, when he arrives at the restaurant, he sees that there is a long line of people waiting to order food. However, because he has already placed his order, Akarsh is able to bypass the line and quickly retrieve his food. He is grateful for the convenience provided by the food delivery app and is able to enjoy a delicious meal without wasting any time waiting in line.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The "Order It" project emphasized the importance of understanding user behavior, needs, and challenges through comprehensive user research. By conducting ethnographic studies, interviews, and focus groups, we were able to gain valuable insights into how students interact with food services on campus, and how a digital solution could improve their experience.</p>

        <p>The research informed the design and development of a user-centered platform that not only streamlines food ordering but also addresses the specific pain points encountered by students and restaurants alike. The iterative process of ideation, prototyping, and user testing ensured that our final product was both functional and intuitive.</p>
