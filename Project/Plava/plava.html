        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on building a system to connect students interested in playing similar sports or games. A key feature is the secure login system, which uses school credentials for data security, ensuring that only students with valid university credentials can access the application. Once logged in, users complete a profile that includes their name, pronouns, a brief bio, their sports interests, and their experience level. The system allows users to request to join existing groups or create new ones based on the game and the user’s level. Additionally, users receive friend recommendations, and the search functionality makes it easy to find friends or groups, while features for managing current friends and groups are also included.</p>

        <p>The platform enables users to message their friends or groups, allowing them to coordinate and find partners for games. Groups can be public or private, with private groups accessible by invite only, while public groups are open to everyone. This cross-platform mobile application, addresses the problem of students feeling excluded when they don’t have a partner to play with, ultimately connecting like-minded people. The platform enhances community engagement and creates a social network for students interested in sports.</p>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction" class="intro-section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In today’s fast-paced university environments, students often face challenges when trying to find partners to participate in sports and recreational activities. Many students feel left out simply because they are unable to connect with others who share their sports interests. Traditional ways of organizing games, such as through word-of-mouth or bulletin boards, are often inefficient and limit students’ ability to meet new people.</p>

        <p>With the increasing reliance on digital platforms for social and recreational purposes, we identified a gap for a system that specifically helps students connect based on their shared interest in sports. This research project aims to design and develop a mobile application that addresses this issue by allowing students to create profiles, form groups, and join games based on their interests and skill levels.</p>

        <p>The goal is to create a user-friendly, secure, and effective platform that fosters social interaction among university students, giving them the opportunity to meet new people, stay active, and engage in sports and games without the hassle of finding teammates or partners. By leveraging university credentials for login and data security, the system ensures that the community remains safe, while providing students with a seamless way to organize and participate in recreational activities.</p>

    <!-- User Population Section -->
    <section id="user-population" class="user-population-section">
        <h2>User Population</h2>
        <p>
            My user population is college students, and I primarily chose this group because my project focuses on connecting 
            students to others for playing sports and games. This problem is prevalent on college campuses, where students often 
            struggle to find partners or groups for recreational activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            To gather insights, I went to the recreational center and spoke with students waiting outside the courts to join games, 
            as well as random students in the library for the cultural probe. The participants in the cultural probe were all 
            college students, ranging from freshman to senior year, and majoring in various fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on the feedback from the cultural probe, it became evident that there is a significant need for an application 
            that connects students interested in similar sports and games. Participants expressed interest in features such as 
            recommendations for people and groups with similar interests, the ability to send messages to connected friends or 
            groups they are part of, and search functionality for finding others with similar sports interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, most users mentioned that they would prefer to choose players based on shared interests and experience 
            level in the sport. This feedback is essential for designing a system that fulfills these needs effectively.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates the importance of understanding user behavior and preferences when designing a platform that connects college students for sports and games. 
            By conducting a cultural probe and gathering insights through affinity diagrams and cognitive walkthroughs, the design of the prototype was iterated upon to ensure it meets 
            the needs of its users. The final low-fidelity prototype addresses the core problem of connecting students with like-minded peers, offering them opportunities to engage in 
            recreational activities with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future iterations of the design will focus on improving search functionality, expanding messaging capabilities, and integrating with external platforms to further enhance the 
            user experience. This prototype serves as a foundation for developing a fully functional application that solves the problem of isolation in campus recreational activities.
