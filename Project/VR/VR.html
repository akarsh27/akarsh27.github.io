    <!-- Game Development Section -->
    <section id="development" class="development-section">
        <h2>Game Development with Unity</h2>
        <p>The VR Maze Game was built using Unity, a powerful cross-platform game engine. Unity allowed for the integration of complex 3D models, 
        realistic physics, and immersive VR interactions. Here are some key aspects of the development process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> The mazes and environments were created using Unity's built-in 3D tools, alongside external software for more detailed assets like trees, rocks, and terrain features.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Changes:</strong> Dynamic seasonal themes were implemented using Unity's lighting system and particle effects to transition between spring, summer, autumn, and winter seamlessly.</li>
            <li><strong>Physics & Movement:</strong> Unity's physics engine was used to calculate player movement, collisions, and environmental interactions, ensuring smooth and responsive VR controls.</li>
            <li><strong>VR Integration:</strong> Using Unity’s XR plugin, the game was optimized for virtual reality, ensuring high frame rates and low latency for a smooth VR experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Level Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1 - Summer:</strong> “Flower Path” serves as the intro level, allowing players to get familiar with the environment and navigate the maze using visual cues and movement mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2 - Autumn:</strong> Players face more complex mazes with added environmental obstacles like fallen leaves and hidden paths.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 3 - Winter:</strong> Challenging icy paths and restricted movements push players to use both sight and sound to navigate the maze.</li>
        </ul>
