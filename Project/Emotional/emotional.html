                <p>Emotional Analysis is a cutting-edge tool designed to harness the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning to detect and predict emotions from text data. This project focuses on analyzing English sentences or paragraphs and classifying emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and more. Whether it's a single sentence or an entire paragraph, the system can detect the dominant emotional tone and provide valuable insights.</p>
                <p>The Emotional Analysis tool is designed to be highly accurate, leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models to interpret nuanced emotional cues in language. It offers a versatile solution for applications ranging from customer feedback analysis to mental health evaluations. By understanding the emotional context of the content, organizations and individuals can make more informed decisions based on sentiment data.</p>

    <!-- Detailed Description Section -->
    <section id="description" class="detailed-description">
        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The challenge is to analyze text and detect various emotions within it. Emotional tone plays a significant role in how we perceive communication. With advancements in deep learning, this project seeks to build a model that detects and categorizes emotions from any given text input.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>This project uses a powerful combination of deep learning and natural language processing. The methodology involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Tokenizing, cleaning, and preparing text data using NLTK.</li>
            <li><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> Implementing an LSTM-based neural network to capture sequential dependencies in text.</li>
            <li><strong>Emotion Classification:</strong> Training the model to detect emotions like joy, anger, and sadness based on labeled data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation & Results</h3>
        <p>The project was implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning. After training on labeled datasets, the model achieved high accuracy in classifying emotions from both short sentences and large paragraphs. The visualizations below demonstrate the accuracy and predictions on the test data.</p>
