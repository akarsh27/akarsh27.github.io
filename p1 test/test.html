      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>We are building a system which will connect the athletes to the doctors.
        Here we want to implement Google O-Auth for data security. The athletes will be able enter the required injury which they are suffering currently, post which the system will show the list of expert doctors in that domain along with their availability and ratings. The athletes can schedule their appointment with the required doctor after looking at their rating and availability date. The athletes will be able to rate the doctor after their session depending on various parameters.
        The current state-of-art is the UHS online appointment scheduling system. Our initial impression of it is that it is not user-friendly. One cannot see doctor’s information, and has to go through a badly-designed survey to see the appointment slots. We want to build a website that is more user-friendly.
        Currently we are starting off this project by building a web-based platform for them to connect but in future we will definitely build a cross platform app which will render both on Android and IoS devices.</p>

        <h2>UNDERSTANDING</h2>
        <p>We did CI with 3 athletes in UW Madison.
          According to our initial understanding, doctor and appointments choices are crucial in our design space. That is why we focused on doctor descriptions and ratings.
          The problems we identified from Cis are different from our initial understanding. Immediate availability is the most crucial for athletes. If one doctor is immediately available, they most likely would go with it. In contrast, rating is not that important. However, UHS don’t have an emergent service, and don’t even prioritize different patients. They have to wait the same amount of time as others with minor problems. This finding is reflected in the following story board:</p>
